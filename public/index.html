                With technology advancement at a rapid rate, the skills relevant
                for competency evolve continuously. As seasoned professionals in
                training and coaching, Simon and Christine face the challenge of
                innovating and tailoring their curriculum and methodologies to
                the different generations.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                After a spontaneous sharing of their vision with each other,
                Simon and Christine's common goals led to the birth of
                Mindsphere Singapore.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                A purpose driven by passion, Mindsphere is the union of their
                compassion, dedication and expertise in training and coaching.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Together, the founding partners came out with the Learning
                Sphere which you will find incorporated in all our programmes
                and the Curriculum Pyramid which guides the development of our
                curriculum. Backed by their impressive training record, they
                have painstakingly designed the curriculum of our signature
                programmes from scratch.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                At Mindsphere, we constantly seek new methods and ideas to
                deliver effective teaching with workforce relevance in mind.
                Regardless how you define success, we believe every learner
                deserves a chance at it. We uphold the highest standards of
                integrity and ethics, and more than a learning hub, we are a

                        embodies multi-talent; she started teaching at the
                        tender age of 17 and with patience as her strongest
                        virtue, she advocates inclusive education for both
                        neurotypical and special needs children.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For close to 20 years now, she pursues her passion as an
                        educator fervently, with an inclination towards guiding
                        students who struggle with passing exams to eventually
                        pass with flying colors. At 35, she took up the role of
                        Adjunct Lecturer at the School of Business and
                        Accountancy with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, extending her
                        impact to adult teaching and motivating them to greater
                        heights in their careers. She has impacted over 10,000
                        students till date.

                        One of Simon’s greatest strengths lies in his skillful
                        use of analogies. He has a remarkable talent for drawing
                        parallels that make abstract ideas relatable and
                        concrete, leaving a lasting impact on his listeners. His
